### Conversation Memory

Based on the context, it looks like you're asking about the **project knowledge base (KB)** content from the documents you shared. Here's a quick summary of what's in the KB from the documents above: --- ## Contents of the Project KB ### 1. **WebOrion URL Health Status**

- **Explains URL status codes:** - **Blackout in progress**: URL not monitored, no verifications or alerts. - **OK**: Webpage matches the baseline. - **Warning**: Webpage differs from baseline. - **Continuous Monitoring**: System checks for further changes from last alert; alerts are sent on changes. - **Awaiting Verification**: Baselined, waiting for next check. - **Baseline Incomplete**: Error adding URL, needs re-adding. - **Status Flow:** - Awaiting verification → OK → Warning → Continuous Monitoring - Alerts are triggered when the webpage content changes from the baseline and further changes. - Instructions to turn on/off continuous monitoring for specific URLs. - **Visual Flowcharts:** - Shows how statuses transition and when alerts trigger (for example: A→B→C versions). --- ### 2. **CoSpaceGPT On-Prem Deployment**
- **System Architecture Overview:** - User side: Device/Browser - Vercel: Edge Network & Secure Compute - Customer Private Cloud: CoSpaceGPT On-Prem deployment --- ### 3. **QuartzV2 for CoSpaceGPT User Persona Worksheet**
- **Target Personas Example:** - Example: Admissions leadership in higher education, Household CFOs, Busy professionals - Their goals, daily behaviors, pain points, skills, how to reach them, product and support needs, and marketing strategies. --- ## **Key Takeaways**
- **WebOrion** info helps you understand webpage monitoring/alerting. - **CoSpaceGPT** sections detail deployment and user personas. - **QuartzV2** worksheet covers customer segmentation and pain points. If you want **details** from any specific document or section, just ask!

[TABLE 1]
Component | On Prem Setup
Vercel | Use Vercel Secure Compute (https://vercel.com/docs/secure-compute) :
• Functions run in isolated network
• Has
static egress IP
• Use VPC peering or VPN to talk to the cloud resources
Supabase | Option 1: Use Supabase Self-Hosted in VPC (Docker)
(https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting)
Option 2: Contact Supabase Enterprise team to ask for
Private VPC Peering
(https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/privatelink)
Pinecone | Use Pinecone Enterprise:
• Supports
PrivateLink/VPC Peering on AWS
(https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/production/connect-to-aws-privatelink)
• All calls stay within AWS backbone
Custom API
Server | AWS 0 Deploy in same VPC (e.g., EC2, ECS, Lambda inside VPC), restrict
access only to Vercel Secure Compute IP
Blob Store (S3,
R2) | Use S3 with private bucket policy, only allow access from Secure
Compute fixed IP or same VPC Table Summary: Table 1 with 6 rows on page 2 How This Meets Customer Data Control Requirements [TABLE 2]
Requirement | Fulfilled? | How
Data stays in customer's
cloud/VPC | ✅ | Vercel Secure Compute peers into
customer's AWS/GCP VPC
No public API calls for
sensitive ops | ✅ | Vercel → Private VPC via peering / fixed
IP
Database not public | ✅ | Supabase hosted in VPC, or access only
from fixed IP
Vector DB secure | ✅ | Pinecone via PrivateLink or replace with
Qdrant inside VPC Table Summary: Table 2 with 5 rows on page 2 CoSpaceGPT - On Prem Deployment 2

**Page 3:**
[TABLE 3]
Requirement | Fulfilled? | How
Minimal vendor lock-in | ✅ | All key services run in private infra
Regulatory data control | ✅ | Full control of database, compute, and
storage boundaries Table Summary: Table 3 with 3 rows on page 3 Potential FAQ Does any customer data leave our VPC or controlled environment? No. Vercel Secure Compute uses fixed IPs and can connect only to services within your VPC. Supabase and Pinecone support private networking (VPC Peering or PrivateLink). All sensitive APIs, vector stores, and files reside in the customer- controlled cloud. Can Vercel access or log our data in transit or at rest? No. Vercel Secure Compute does not inspect function payloads. Vercel functions with Secure Compute run in isolated containers with egress-only access, and no telemetry captures payload unless explicitly enabled. Can we audit which IPs access each internal system (DB, APIs, vector store)? Yes. All traffic passes through your private VPC and can be monitored via VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, or NGINX logs. Vercel Secure Compute uses fixed outbound IPs for predictable allow-listing. Are databases, vector stores, and API servers publicly accessible? No. All systems are deployed inside private subnets or with private VPC endpoints. Only internal IPs (e.g., from Vercel SC) can access them. CoSpaceGPT - On Prem Deployment 3

**Page 4:**
Can we host all services entirely within our own cloud account? Yes. You can self-host Supabase, Qdrant (or vector DB), and API services in your AWS/GCP/Azure account. Vercel functions connect to them securely. Are backups encrypted and stored in our infrastructure? Yes. You control all backup routines for your databases, vector stores, and object storage. You can use AWS-native services (e.g., S3 with encryption, RDS snapshots). Does this architecture use OpenAI, third-party LLMs, or SaaS inference endpoints? All redaction/guardrail inference is run within your private API servers. But we still talk to LLM providers API servers on the internet. Where are file uploads stored, and can we disable public URLs? Files are stored in private S3 buckets or internal object stores (Cloudfront). Buckets are configured with private access policies, and no public URLs are generated. Is this architecture compliant with GDPR / HIPAA / SOC 2 data isolation requirements? Yes. All sensitive data is isolated in your VPC, with complete control over egress points, encryption, logging, and access policies. Can we restrict Vercel to only access resources from within a specific region? Yes. You can configure Secure Compute functions to run in the same region as your infrastructure and block all cross-region or cross-zone access. Is any telemetry or usage data sent to Vercel, Supabase, or Pinecone? CoSpaceGPT - On Prem Deployment 4

**Page 5:**
Only basic system metadata (e.g., cold start metrics) is sent, and this can be disabled or anonymized for Enterprise plans. No payload or database content is shared. What happens if Vercel Secure Compute goes down? Is there fallback? You can use custom health checks and replicate APIs in multiple regions. Vercel will retry on cold-start, and your internal infra is unaffected. Vercel provides a SLA of 99.9%. What is the attack surface, and how can we harden it? The only entry point is through Vercel → Secure Compute → your VPC. CoSpaceGPT - On Prem Deployment 5
